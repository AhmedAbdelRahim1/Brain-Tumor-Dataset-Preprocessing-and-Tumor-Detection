# Brain Tumor Detection
Brain Tumor Image Dataset Preprocessing
Introduction:
This repository provides a comprehensive guide on preprocessing a dataset containing grayscale images of infected patients' brain X-rays. The preprocessing steps outlined below are essential to ensure the dataset is clean, well-organized, and ready for use in machine-learning tasks related to brain tumor detection.

Preprocessing Steps

Data Cleaning:

Handle any corrupted or unreadable images by removing them from the dataset.
Ensure that all images have consistent dimensions, and resize them if necessary to meet the input requirements of your machine learning model.
Data Transformation:

Image Augmentation (optional): Apply data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and random cropping to increase the diversity of your image data. This can help improve model generalization.
Normalize Pixel Values: Scale pixel values to a specific range (e.g., [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) to ensure uniformity in data distribution. This step is crucial for model convergence.
Convert Images to NumPy Arrays: Convert the image data into NumPy arrays for compatibility with machine learning frameworks.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. A common split ratio is 70-80% for training, 10-15% for validation, and 10-15% for testing. Ensure that the data distribution among classes is balanced in each split.
Data Labeling:

Assign labels to the images based on their diagnostic outcomes (e.g., tumor or non-tumor). Create a mapping of labels to numeric values.
Data Storage:

Save the preprocessed images and their corresponding labels in an organized directory structure. Consider using subdirectories for each class (e.g., "tumor" and "non-tumor").
Documentation:

Document all preprocessing steps thoroughly, including code, parameters used, and any decisions made during the process. Ensure that file names, labels, and data splits are well-documented for future reference.
Conclusion
Proper preprocessing of grayscale brain X-ray images is essential for building accurate machine learning models for tumor detection or classification. Following the steps outlined in this README, you can prepare your dataset effectively, making it suitable for training and evaluating machine learning models. Adjust the preprocessing steps as needed to accommodate the specific requirements of your project and research objectives.
